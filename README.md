# Learn MithrilJS: Build a Game News App with Authentication

### Setup

We will begin the tutorial by setting up our tools we will be using. Without further ado, let's get started!

### Installation
Clone this repository, then navigate to the `TutorialMaterials` directory where the project lives.  Here is a glance at how the project is structured:

```
README.md
    | TutorialMaterials
        index.html
        style.css
        package.json
        src
            auth.js
            index.js
            | views
                game-news-list.js
                login-button.js
                navbar.js
                news.js
```

After you clone the project and navigate into the `Tutorial Files` directory, open a terminal and navigate to the Tutorial Files directory to where `index.html` lives. Open `index.html` in a browser and run `npm start` to run the project.
